Jason's Text Editor

# Project Name

Text Editor Web Application

## Description

This is a text editor web application that allows users to create and save notes or code snippets, with or without an internet connection. The application provides a reliable way to retrieve these notes for later use. It consists of a client-server folder structure and utilizes various technologies like JavaScript, IndexedDB, service workers, and webpack.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When I open my application in my editor, I should see a client-server folder structure.
2. When I run `npm run start` from the root directory, the application should start up the backend and serve the client.
3. When I run the text editor application from my terminal, the JavaScript files should be bundled using webpack.
4. When I run my webpack plugins, I should have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
5. When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application, the text editor should still function in the browser without errors.
6. When I open the text editor, IndexedDB should immediately create a database storage.
7. When I enter content in the text editor and click off of the DOM window, the content should be saved with IndexedDB.
8. When I reopen the text editor after closing it, the content should be retrieved from IndexedDB.
9. When I click on the Install button, I should be able to download the web application as an icon on my desktop.
10. When I load the web application, there should be a registered service worker using workbox.
11. When I register a service worker, my static assets should be pre-cached upon loading, along with subsequent pages and static assets.
12. When I deploy to Render, there should be proper build scripts for a webpack application.

## Installation
